		// ISRU Descriptions
		#kpresources_isru_size0_desc = This initial design tiny ISRU will convert HydrateOre or Saturate to produce LiquidFuel.  Limited in size and capability.
		#kpresources_isru_size1_desc = This initial design ISRU is limited in scope, but will take NaturalOre and extract the Oxidizing elements to produce Oxidizer.
		#kpresources_isru_size2_desc = This primary design ISRU will convert NaturalOre to Oxidizer, but also HydrateOre or Saturate to LiquidFuel or other useful propellants.
		#kpresources_isru_size3_desc = An upgraded ISRU that will produce all the fuels that you will need from various Liquid to Solid Fuels.
		#kpresources_isru_size4_desc = An advanced quantum device that allows the transmutation of Ores into fuels with little watsage.  Simply add the Ores and power to go!
